                It has always been my dream to design, decorate and dress events, especially weddings. With just over 4 years experience in the art department for film and TV, I can help you achieve strong and beautiful visuals that work well for the camera. I work efficiently and attentively to ensure the final bespoke design brings your ideas to life. I also love meeting and working with other creatives too; I have contacts for photography and flowers should you require those services as well. My aim is to create a beautiful day for you and your guests, and also take the stress out of achieving the final look for your venue.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am happy to source/create decor for your venue; please get in touch if this is something youâ€™d like me to help with, and I will do my best to accommodate.
